My thoughts on possible projects of interest so far are quite few. I have a small amount of interest in working on something connected to the school, such as shuttle tracker, as that is something that could impact me directly. However, I haven't really found many places for projects outside these obvious close connections. I honestly don't really know where to start looking for something to help work on, and coming up with something on my own feels tremendously daunting.
Besides that, I think a Blessed repository is the most appealing way to organize a project. If you created the idea and want to have the main source of input you can become the integration manager and choose the direction of the project. Also, many people can work on such project and still align with the integration managers main vision. A Blessed repository is probably best used with a good amount of people working on the same project, so if I end up picking something of a smaller scale it might not be nessesary.
